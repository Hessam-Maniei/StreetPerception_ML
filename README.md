This repository contains the data processing, analysis, and visualization pipeline developed as part of my PhD research in spatial planning. The project focuses on quantifying streetscape perception using semantic segmentation and pixel-based indicators.

### Overview
This repository builds upon the semantic segmentation outputs generated by a U-Net model
(see Segmentation-UNet repository) and extends the analysis through statistical modeling,
database structuring, and machine-learning regression.
